# tetris

Tetris game made in pure Python using the [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news) engine.

## TODO

1. Make clockwise and counter clockwise movements
2. Rotation is still weird (cases where rotation goes outside board)
3. Add enums to stuff like colors, move directions, etc
4.Change self.state update to only when can_move is True
